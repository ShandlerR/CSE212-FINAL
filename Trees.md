# Trees in Python
## Introduction
Trees are data strctures that allow us to organize information that will stay in a consistent order from the top of the tree to the bottom of the tree, and at any sub point. A tree is like a linked list where the only way to access information on level 2 is to go through the node on level 1. However, A tree differs by the fact that there can be multiple nodes on level two that connect to a single node on level 1. The way the tree is organized can allow us to store very large pieces of informaion, but still have very good efficency when it comes to information lookup and adding new pieces of information to the tree.
